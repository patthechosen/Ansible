# DESCRIPTION
This Ansible playbook configures both Ubuntu and Amazon Linux EC2 instances by installing Apache with a custom welcome message on Ubuntu clients and ensuring Git is installed and verified. It includes ad-hoc ping checks for connectivity validation and uses the debug module to display the authorâ€™s name on all hosts. The playbook demonstrates the use of dynamic inventory and remote user configuration for automated server provisioning.
